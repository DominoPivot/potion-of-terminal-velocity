		You are an amateur alchemist under the tutelage of an inflexible master. The grumpy old gnome keeps yapping about the fundamentals and never lets you put his teachings to practice. BO-RING!
	<p>
		You've decided to take matters into your own hands, and have <em>borrowed</em> his equipment to learn <em>the fun way</em>, through trial and error. It's not without risk, as <strong>any ingredient you add is bound to have unpredictable consequences</strong>, even if they are not immediately apparent.
	<p>
		As you were sneaking out of your master's lab with a big heavy chest full of alchemical supplies, you tripped on a toadstool and fell down a chasm. <i>Who even left that here?</i> On the off chance that this pit isn't actually bottomless, now might be a good time to figure out how to craft a potion of resistance to fall damage.
	<p>
		You can interact with the world by typing commands in the terminal below, such as <code>LOOK AROUND</code> or <code>DRINK POTION</code>. Good luck!
